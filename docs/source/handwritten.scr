@title(Handwritten documentation)

I think the ability to write a large pieces of documentation which aren't bound to
a function, class or module is an important feature. This way you can tell the user
about some toplevel abstractions and give a bird eye view on the library or system.

For example, handwritten parts of the documentation can provide some code snippets
to demonstrate the ways, how to use the library:

@begin[lang=lisp](code)
(loop repeat 42
      collect (foo "bar" 100500))
@end(code)

And when you are talking about some function or class, you might want to reference it.
For example, if I'm talking about @c(foo) function, I want a reference to become a link.

However @c(Codex) does not support cross referencing.
There is a @c(@ref) tag, but @link[uri="http://commondoc.github.io/scriba/docs/reference.html#links"](seems) you have to
make anchors manually.
